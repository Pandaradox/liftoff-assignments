# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
Include overview here:

After 14 years of volunteering for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), I've had the pleasure of meeting many children and teens afflicted with MD.  Over the years, there are some tragic hallmarks of the disease's progression such as becoming dependent on a motorized wheelchair or needing assistance with eating.  The nature of the needs of each teen and child means complications can vary but one common thread persists: Dependence on social media and digital communication.  Because of this, keyboard technology plays an essential role in accessing that communication but we have not seen any profound development in that technology.  Current keyboards do not prioritize minimal movement but rather favors familiarity with the traditional QWERTY style.  People with physical limitations often find using these keyboards difficult or tiring.  Often, it is the limited individual that is forced to adapt when it arguably should be the other way around.

This project intends to remedy this in part.  I want to design a new digital keyboard format that'll minimize finger movement and lean on newer technologies like predictive text and emojis to facilitate this shift.  I believe a ring-style keyboard will be best for reducing distances.  The first ring will consist of letters, the second ring will be punctuation, and the third ring will be suggested words based on user history and analysis of traditional vernacular.  

### Features
Include Features here:

--Introducing letter pairings: Instead of each letter being a button, have pairs of letters based on commonly occurring pairs of letters (based on analysis of all words in the language).  Using predictive texting and statistical analysis, I believe it should be possible to type using pairs of letters which would halve the typing time and reducing button presses.

--Emoji integration: The usage of emojis has become a language in itself.  This feature will introduce a switch that'll change the rings to emojis for quick access.

--User profile: Tracking the last pre-determined amount of words by the user, this feature will assist in typing by providing recent words, saving button presses.  The number of tracked words could be optional.

--Swype Integration: Using a drawing path, integrate the Swype technology into the keyboard, possibly increasing typing speed.

--Multi-ring: This feature will allow for multiple rings to be on the screen at a time, allowing for two-thumb or multi-finger typing that would significantly increase typing speed with experience.

--Text Editing: This feature will introduce a switch to common text editing commands like Cut, Paste, Select All.  

--Dynamic Sizing: This feature will shift the sizes of the various buttons as the user gestures away from it, causing the ones gestured towards to grow while the ones gestured away from to shrink, permitting clearer typing.
